Social Sharing Friday saw 19 new cases of the virus confirmed across Ontario, bringing the provincial total to 79 CBC News · Posted: Mar 13, 2020 10:03 AM ET | Last Updated: March 13, 2020 Customers struggled to find cleaning supplies at a downtown Toronto Metro store on Friday. Many have been stocking up on supplies as concerns around the spread of COVID-19 grow. (Submitted by Doug Earl) comments As Ontario contends with its single-biggest increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases, new measures are underway to limit the spread of the virus — affecting universities, childcare facilities, provincial transit, tourist attractions and other services. The provincial transit agency, Metrolinx, has announced a selective reduction in GO train and bus, as well as Union-Pearson Express services, effective Wednesday, March 18. Revised schedules are being finalized and will be available Sunday at noon.  Effective 12:01 a.m. March 14, the following services will also be closed or cancelled in Toronto: all licensed childcare centres, March Break camps, libraries, community and recreation centres, arenas, pools and fitness centres. Nearby regions announced similar closures. But while Ontario's top doctor recommended the immediate suspension of all large events and public gatherings of over 250 people, city officials in Toronto said Friday afternoon that suspension does not apply to public transit. TTC services will operate as usual, city officials said. Toronto shutting down major city services amid growing number of COVID-19 cases Friday saw 19 new cases of the virus confirmed across Ontario, bringing the provincial total to 79. As concerns grow, residents are seeing chaotic scenes at grocery stores across the GTA as more and more people looked to stockpile supplies amid fears that the novel coronavirus will continue its spread, despite expert warnings to avoid panic buying. Many shoppers documented their unusual experiences at their local stores on social media, posting pictures and video of winding line ups and empty shelves.

(Lisa Naccarato/CBC) Public health officials, however, are advising against hoarding too many goods that others need as well. Be prepared, they say, but don't allow fears of COVID-19 to fuel irrational purchases and stockpiling of non-essential items. What should you buy? On its website, Health Canada says residents should "stock up on essentials, but avoid panic buying."

Canada won't be wiped out of toilet paper, says leading manufacturer What is the current status of COVID-19 in Canada? As of late Thursday, there are at least 179 confirmed and presumed cases of COVID-19 in Canada. Seventy-nine of those cases are in Ontario, mainly concentrated throughout the GTA. The total includes a new case that was reported late Thursday — in Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, the prime minister's wife. The new cases include men and woman ranging in age from their 20s to 80s. One man, in his 80s, has been hospitalized while the rest — in Toronto, York Region, Peel Region, Ottawa, Niagara, and Waterloo — are in self-isolation. The situation is fluid and more updates from public health officials across the country are expected throughout today.  Some of the first dedicated coronavirus screening centres were set-up at six hospitals and health centres throughout the province yesterday. Cancel large gatherings, Ontario's top doctor says Ontario's chief medical officer of health is recommending the immediate suspension of all large events and public gatherings of over 250 people In a memo to be issued today, Dr. David Williams says organizers of smaller gatherings should consult with their local public health unit. He says all Ontarians should practice social distancing as much as possible to manage the spread of coronavirus. Universities, colleges move online A number of post-secondary institutions throughout the GTA have chosen to move classes online. The list includes: University of Toronto: All on-campus classes will be cancelled across all three campuses from March 16 until April 3, when classes end. Ryerson University: Effective today, all classes and exams are being shifted to "virtual and other alternative forms of delivery." Those changes will be in place by March 23, the school says.

Concerns about the virus' spread led to a wave of cancellations and postponements yesterday, including in major league sports like basketball, hockey and baseball, as well as major concerts and other kinds of gatherings. For example, here in the GTA a number of big mosques have either suspended Friday prayer services indefinitely or drastically altered how those services will be delivered. Furthermore, a Toronto organization that planned to honour the lives of those who died in a plane crash in Iran has cancelled in-person events for its celebration of the Persian New Year. Tirgan said it has moved its Nowruz festival online. The annual event attracts upwards of 15,000 people, many part of the large Iranian-Canadian diaspora in the Toronto area. Many performances have been postponed, while others will continue this weekend without an audience in order to be recorded, then shown online. Meanwhile, Ontario's Ministry of Education announced that all publicly-funded elementary, junior and high schools will be closed from March 14 to April 5. Similarly, the CN Tower will be closed to visitors beginning March 14, Canada Lands Company says. All operations at the tower and Downsview Park have been temporarily suspended until at least April 14, or until local health authorities recommend otherwise. The Art Gallery of Ontario also announced they will be closed from March 13 to April 5. The Royal Ontario Museum said it also anticipates being closed for the same period.  With files from Lucas Powers and The Canadian Press CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsReport Typo or Error Related Stories THE LATEST Coronavirus: Here's what's happening in Canada and around the world on March 13 THE DOSE COVID-19: The latest guidance for Canadians on travel, quarantines and what to do if you have symptoms Comments To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).
