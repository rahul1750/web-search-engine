Elliott announced "I'm in" on Twitter on Thursday afternoon, confirming earlier reporting by CBC News. Elliott ran for the party's leadership twice but was defeated by Tim Hudak, and later by Patrick Brown. Brown resigned as leader following allegations of sexual misconduct from two women.  She is currently the province's medical patient ombudsman — a position she was appointed to by Premier Kathleen Wynne. Elliott, who was married to the late Conservative finance minister Jim Flaherty, is also a former deputy leader of the PCs and represented Whitby–Oshawa from 2006 until her resignation in 2015.
